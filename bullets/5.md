This is awesome writeup which covers a DOM XSS. Researcher is able to get dom xss javascript:alert(document.domain) on .html page. Interesting thing to read is, we 
then use ffuf to fuzz vulnerable paths. Next up, we can also utilize httpx and run it on a couple of subdomains. At the end, researcher was able to get the same DOM XSS across 
12 different vulnerable endpoints.
